# PythonCalculator

This is **Project 2** of **IS 601**. A Python program using principles of automated testing.

## Description:
* The calculator is one application that we all use in our day to day lives. This **PythonCalculator** is a Python program using principles of automated testing.
* It performs basic arithmetic operations. I Learned to use static methods, object methods, object attributes/properties.
* And also used the CSV files to load data for unit tests. There's each file to test the associated operation.
* Also used Travis CI in this project. IT is a hosted continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted on GitHub.

## Arithmetic Operations:
* Addition,
* Subtraction,
* Multiplication,
* Division,
* Square,
* Square root

## Statistics Operations:
* Mean
* Median
* Mode
* Variance
* Standard Deviation 

## Resources required  to run the Unit tests are,

* [Calculator.py](https://github.com/Milan-36/PythonCalculator/blob/master/src/Calculator.py) (It contians all python function to perform arithmetic operations).
* [CalculatorTests.py](https://github.com/Milan-36/PythonCalculator/blob/master/src/CalculatorTests.py) (Unit Test file to perfom individual tests of source code).
* [CsvReader.py](https://github.com/Milan-36/PythonCalculator/blob/master/src/CsvReader.py) (To read the csv file and convert the data into list, and dictionary to store in memory.).
* [StaticVariables.py](https://github.com/Milan-36/PythonCalculator/blob/master/src/StaticVariables.py) (To refer to the common property of all objects).
* [CSV File](https://github.com/Milan-36/PythonCalculator/tree/master/src/csv) (comma-separated values files are used to read and test data in Unit Tests).
